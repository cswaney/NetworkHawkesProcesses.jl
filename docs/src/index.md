## Installation
Installing the package is easy. Simply launch a Julia REPL session by entering `julia` at the command line, press `]` to activate the package manager, and then type `add NetworkHawkesProcesses`. After the package finishes downloading and installing you can import it by typing `using NetworkHawkesProcesses` at the `julia>` prompt.


## Background
Hawkes processes are a class of inhomogeneous, autoregressive Poisson processes used to model the arrival of events that demonstrate "self-exciting" behavior, e.g., seismic activity. The intensity of a univariate Hawkes process given a sequence of events ``\{ s_i \}_{i=1}^N`` has the generic representation

```math
\lambda(t) = \lambda^{(0)}(t) + \sum_{s_i < t} h(t - s_i \ | \ \theta),
```

where ``\lambda^{(0)}`` is the (possibly inhomogenous) baseline intensity of the process in the absence of events, and ``h(\Delta t)`` is a non-negative impulse response that captures the increase in intensity due to each event. Simply put, every event arrival temporarily increases the likelihood of future events.

Multivariate Hawkes processes introduce the possibility of interactions between processes. The generic intensity of the ``n``-th process given a sequence of events ``\{ s_i \}_{i=1}^N`` occurring on corresponding processes ``\{ c_i \}_{i=1}^N`` is given by

```math
\lambda_n(t) = \lambda_n^{(0)}(t) + \sum_m \sum_{\substack{c_i = m,\\ s_i < t}} h_{m,n}(t - s_i \ | \ \theta_{m,n}),
```

where the impulse response ``h(\Delta t \ | \ \theta_{m,n})`` now depends on the "parent" process, ``m``, and "child" process, ``n``.

`NetworkHawkesProcess.jl` aims to support a class of probabilistic models that combines multivariate Hawkes processes with network models, as demonstrated by [Linderman & Adams, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0914). The intensity of such models takes the form

```math
\lambda_n(t) = \lambda_n^{(0)}(t) + \sum_m \sum_{\substack{c_i = m,\\ s_i < t}} a_{m,n} h_{m,n}(t - s_i \ | \ \theta_{m,n}),
```
where ``a_{m,n}`` is a binary variable representing the existence of a directed link from process ``m`` to process ``n`` generated by a process

```math
a_{m,n} \sim p(a_{m,n} \ | \ \eta_{m,n})
```

These models--"network Hawkes processes"--allow simultaneously inference on the structure of a network and its event generating process.

This package provides support for continuous-time and discrete-time network Hawkes processes. It provides multiple inference procedures, including maximum-likelihood/maximum-a-posteriori estimation, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and variational inference. Furthermore, it provides a flexible set of components to build such models that users can extend to construct new models.
